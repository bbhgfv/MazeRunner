Introduction

In this project, we deal with the topic of iteration and recursion.
Our focus is on the implementation of the MazeSolver, which is to guide a MazeRunner through a maze. The Labyrinth is represented as a grid with different cells, from
some of which are blocked by walls.  The MazeSolver begins at a specific start cell and tries to find the way to the target cell
by moving from cell to cell and bypasses the walls.
 
First I have to lay down the basic framework for the Solve the maze. 
Finally, I will implement a recursive and  iterative solution of the MazeSolver.
